    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates a critical link: the relationship between hospital quality and the socioeconomic conditions of the communities they serve. Drawing on hospital performance data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and socioeconomic indicators from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), the analysis seeks to determine whether hospitals located in more disadvantaged areas experience systematically higher readmission and mortality rates. This research is particularly significant as it confronts structural inequities in healthcare delivery and access. Given the current potential budget cuts and their broader social impact, this study is especially timely, emphasizing how financial constraints and socioeconomic disparities may interact to influence healthcare quality and outcomes. Furthermore, it critically examines whether federal policies, such as the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, unintentionally penalize hospitals that serve the nation’s most vulnerable populations."
